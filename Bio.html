<p>Welcome to my page.</p>
<p>My name is Stefan Beatović. I have played basketball for almost 20 years. At the moment, my family and I live in Dar Es Salaam Tanzania.</p>
<p>I have started photographing about 10 years ago out of fun, as a hobby. I never had big ambitions in becoming world-knowd photographer.</p>
<p>Of course, it would have been nice, but that was not the point from the start. Maybe one day miracles will happen, but how konws.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Right now, as a camera I am using Sony A6400 with Meike Battery Grip.</p>
<p>As for lenses, I am using the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sigma Contemporary 16mm F1.4 DC DN (E-Mount)</li>
    <li>Sigma Contemporary 28-70mm F2.8 DG DN (E-Mount)</li>
    <li>Sigma Contemporary 30mm F1.4 DC DN (E-Mount)</li>
    <li>Sigma Contemporary 56mm F1.4 DC DN (E-Mount)</li>
    <li>Sigma Contemporary 90mm F2.8 DG DN (E-Mount)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>I do also use a drone. At the moment I use DJI Mini 3.</p>

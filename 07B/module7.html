  <h3>History of the CITY</h3>
    <p><em>Where history, finesse, passion, class and soul meet.</em></p>
    <p>Belgrade (Serbian: Београд, Beograd) is the capital and largest city of Serbia. It is located at the 
    confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers and at the crossroads of the Pannonian Plain and the Balkan 
    Peninsula. The population of the Belgrade metropolitan area is 1,685,563 according to the 2022 census. 
    It is one of the major cities of Southeast Europe and the third most populous city on the Danube river.</p>
    <p>Belgrade is known locally as Beograd, which means “white city” or “white fortress.” Beo means “white” 
        and grad means “city.” The city is named for its fortress, which was built on a white ridge that has 
        been of great strategic importance throughout history.</p>
    <p>Belgrade is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Europe and the world. One of the most

        <h2>Serbian cuisine</h2>
        <p>Serbian cuisine (Serbian: српска кухиња / srpska kuhinja) is a Balkan cuisine that consists 
            of the culinary methods and traditions of Serbia. Its roots lie in Serbian history, including 
            centuries of cultural contact and influence with the Greeks and the Byzantine Empire, the 
            Ottomans, and Serbia's Balkan neighbours, especially during the existence of Yugoslavia. 
            Historically, Serbian food develops from pastoral customs that involved the keeping of sheep 
            in mountain highlands, in a climate and regional context that favoured animal husbandry over 
            vegetable farming; Serbian food is therefore traditionally richer in animal products and 
            basic grains—corn, wheat and oats—than fresh vegetable dishes. Following the abandonment 
            of widely practiced pastoral lifestyles, Serbian food emerged through the Middle Ages 
            heavily dependent not on lamb or mutton, but on the keeping of pigs for the annual cull and 
            the production of various cured meats, such as sausages, bacon and ham products.</p>
            <p>In the following tabs, you can find some traditional and popular dishes in Serbia.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu2" class="tab-pane fade">
        <h2>Sarma</h2>
        <p>Sarma (Turkish for "wrapping" or "rolling") is a traditional food in Ottoman cuisine – nowadays, 
            Turkish, Greek, Levantine / Arabic, Armenian, etc. – made of vegetable leaves rolled around a 
            filling of minced meat, grains such as rice, or both. It is commonly marketed in the 
            English-speaking world as stuffed grape leaves, stuffed vine leaves, or stuffed cabbage leaves. 
            The vegetable leaves may be cabbage, patience dock, collard, grapevine, kale or chard leaves. 
            Sarma is part of the broader category of stuffed dishes known as dolma, and has equivalents 
            (such as the Polish Gołąbki) in Eastern European cuisines from the northern Baltic through Romania.</p>

    <div id="menu3" class="tab-pane fade">
        <h2>Karađorđeva šnicla</h2>
        <p>Karađorđeva šnicla (English: Karađorđe's schnitzel, Serbian Cyrillic: Карађорђева шницла) is a 
            breaded cutlet dish named after the Serbian revolutionary Karađorđe. The dish consists of a 
            rolled veal, pork, or chicken steak, stuffed with kaymak, which is then breaded and fried. It 
            is served with tartar sauce and a slice of lemon on the side, and sometimes french fries or 
            steamed vegetables. Created by Josip Broz Tito's chef Mića Stojanović [sr] in 1956 or 1957 as 
            an improvisation of Chicken Kiev, it has become a regular staple in Serbian cuisine. Stojanović 
            unsuccessfully tried to patent his original recipe, which has since been adapted to several 
            variations.</p>

    <div id="menu4" class="tab-pane fade">
        <h2>Pljeskavica</h2>
        <p>Forget McDonald's, Burger King and such. Pljeskavica is here.</p>
        <p>Pljeskavica (Serbian Cyrillic: пљескавица,) is a Serbian grilled dish consisting of a mixture of 
            spiced minced pork, beef and lamb meat.[1] It is one of the national dishes of Serbia and is very 
            popular in the neighbouring Balkan and former Yugoslav countries of Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
            Croatia, and Montenegro. The dish is also popular in Bulgaria and Romania. It is a main course 
            served with onions, kajmak (milk cream), beans, sometimes ajvar (relish), and urnebes (spicy 
            cheese salad), either on plate with side dishes, or with lepinja (flatbread, as a type of 
            hamburger). Recently, pljeskavica has gained popularity elsewhere in Europe and is served in a 
            few speciality fast food restaurants in Germany, Sweden, and Austria. Varieties include the 
            "Leskovac pljeskavica" (Leskovačka pljeskavica), very spicy with onions; "Šar pljeskavica" 
            (Šarska pljeskavica), stuffed with kačkavalj cheese; "Hajduk pljeskavica" (Hajdučka pljeskavica), 
            of beef mixed with smoked pork meat; and "Vranje pljeskavica" (Vranjanska pljeskavica).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu5" class="tab-pane fade">
        <h2>Ćevapi</h2>
        <p>Ćevapi (Cyrillic: ћевапи) or ćevapčići, is a grilled dish of minced meat found traditionally in 
            the countries of southeast Europe (the Balkans). It is considered a national dish of Bosnia and 
            Herzegovina and Serbia, with Bosnia and Herzegovina taking steps in branding and placing them 
            on the list of intangible heritage, with a nomination for inclusion on the UNESCO List of 
            Intangible Cultural Heritage. Ćevapi are also common in Albania, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Croatia, 
            Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Western Romania.

            They are usually served in groups of five to ten pieces on a plate or in a flatbread 
            (lepinja or somun), often with chopped onions, kajmak, ajvar (optional), and salt.
            
            Bosnian ćevapi are made from two types of minced beef meat, hand-mixed and formed with a funnel, 
            while Serbian ćevapčići are made of beef, lamb, pork, or a mixture. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu6" class="tab-pane fade">
        <h2>Pečenje</h2>
        <p>Roasting is a cooking method that uses dry heat where hot air covers the food, cooking it evenly 
            on all sides with temperatures of at least 150 °C (300 °F) from an open flame, oven, or other heat 
            source. Roasting can enhance the flavor through caramelization and Maillard browning on the surface 
            of the food. Roasting uses indirect, diffused heat (as in an oven), and is suitable for slower 
            cooking of meat in a larger, whole piece. Meats and most root and bulb vegetables can be roasted. 
            Any piece of meat, especially red meat, that has been cooked in this fashion is called a roast. 
            Meats and vegetables prepared in this way are described as "roasted", e.g., roasted chicken or 
            roasted squash. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu7" class="tab-pane fade">
        <h2>Burek</h2>
        <p>Börek or burek is a family of pastries or pies found in Ottoman cuisine. The pastry is made of a 
            thin flaky dough such as filo with a variety of fillings, such as meat, cheese, spinach, or 
            potatoes. A borek may be prepared in a large pan and cut into portions after baking, or as 
            individual pastries. They are usually baked but some varieties can be fried. Borek is sometimes 
            sprinkled with sesame or nigella seeds, and it can be served hot or cold.</p>
        <p>The recipe for "round" burek was developed in the Serbian town of Niš. In 1498, it was introduced 
            by a famous Turkish baker, Mehmed Oğlu, from Istanbul. Eventually burek spread from the southeast 
            (southern Serbia, Kosovo and North Macedonia) to the rest of Yugoslavia. Niš hosts an annual burek 
            competition and festival called Buregdžijada. In 2005, a 100 kg (220 lbs) burek was made, with a 
            diameter of 2 metres (≈6 ft) and it is considered to have been the world's biggest burek ever 
            made.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu8" class="tab-pane fade">
        <h2>Ajvar</h2>
        <p>Ajvar (Serbian Cyrillic: Ajвар, Bulgarian: Aйвар, romanized: Ayvar) is a condiment made principally 
            from sweet bell peppers and eggplants. The relish became a popular side dish throughout 
            Yugoslavia after World War II and remains popular in Southeast Europe.

            Homemade ajvar is made of roasted peppers. Depending on the capsaicin content in bell peppers and 
            the amount of added chili peppers, it can be sweet (traditional), piquant (the most common), or 
            very hot. Ajvar can be consumed as a bread spread or as a side dish. Ajvar has a few variations. 
            One variation contains tomato and eggplant, and another green bell peppers and oregano.
            
            "Homemade Leskovac Ajvar" and "Macedonian Ajvar" are registered with the World Intellectual 
            Property Organization in order to protect their brand names.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu9" class="tab-pane fade">
        <h2>Krempita</h2>
        <p>A cremeschnitte (German: Cremeschnitte, Hungarian: krémes, Polish: kremówka, napoleonka, Romanian: 
            cremșnit, cremeș, crempita, Bosnian and Serbian: krempita/кремпита, Croatian: kremšnita, Slovak: 
            krémeš, Slovene: kremna rezina, kremšnita), also known as vanilla slice or custard slice, is a 
            custard and chantilly cream cream cake dessert commonly associated with the former Austro-Hungarian 
            Monarchy. However, its origin is most commonly associated with a city in Slovenia known as Bled 
            where it is called "Blejske kremšnita. This dish remains popular across Central Europe and the 
            Balkans in various variations, all of which include a puff pastry base and custard cream.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu10" class="tab-pane fade">
        <h2>Rakija</h2>
        <p> Rakija, rakia, rachiu, rakı or rakiya, is the collective term for fruit spirits (or fruit brandy) 
            popular in the Balkans. The alcohol content of rakia is normally 40% ABV, but home-produced rakia 
            can be stronger (typically 50–80%).</p>
        <p>Rakija is produced from fermented and distilled fruits, typically plums and grapes, but also 
            apricots, pears, cherries or raspberries. Other fruits less commonly used are peaches, apples, 
            figs, blackberries, and quince. Common flavours are šljivovica and țuică, produced from plums, 
            kajsija, produced from apricots, or grozdova/lozova in Bulgaria, raki rrushi in Albania and 
            Kosovo, lozovača/komovica in Croatia, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina 
            all produced from grapes. These are akin to the pomace brandy called zivania in Cyprus.</p>
